# Agent File Boundaries

You (Cursor) own implementation files. Lovable owns UI primitives. Claude Code owns coordination.
See AGENTS.md and .ai/boundaries.md for the complete map.

## Your Domain (Cursor)

- [REPLACE: List your backend directories]
- [REPLACE: List your hooks directory]
- [REPLACE: List your services/API layer]
- [REPLACE: List logic-heavy components by name]
- [REPLACE: List logic-heavy pages by name]

## Do NOT Modify (Lovable's Domain)

- `src/components/ui/**` — design system
- [REPLACE: List layout components]
- [REPLACE: List UI-only hooks]
- [REPLACE: List global CSS files]

## Do NOT Modify (Claude Code's Domain)

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.ai/`
- `App.tsx` routing structure
- Root configs: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`
- [REPLACE: List auto-generated files]

## If You Need a Change Outside Your Domain

Note it in your task file's handoff notes and set status to BLOCKED.

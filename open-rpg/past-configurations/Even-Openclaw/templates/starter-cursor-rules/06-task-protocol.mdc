# Task Protocol

Check `.ai/tasks/` for your current assignments before starting work.

## Task File Format

```markdown
## TASK-XXX: Title

- **Status**: PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | REVIEW | DONE | BLOCKED
- **Assigned**: cursor | lovable | claude-code
- **Priority**: P0-Critical | P1-High | P2-Medium | P3-Low
- **Type**: Create | Modify | Fix | Refactor
- **Depends on**: TASK-XXX | none
- **Blocks**: TASK-XXX | none

### Context
What exists currently and why this task exists.

### Objective
Specific measurable goal — what "done" looks like.

### Specifications
- Requirement with specifics
- Files/areas in scope

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Testable criterion
- [ ] Build passes, no type errors

### Do NOT
Explicit out-of-scope items.

### Handoff Notes
Updated by the assigned agent when status changes.
```

## Your Workflow

1. Check `.ai/tasks/` for tasks assigned to `cursor` with status `PENDING`
2. Set status to `IN_PROGRESS` before starting
3. Implement according to acceptance criteria
4. Set status to `REVIEW` when done
5. Add handoff notes: what changed, decisions made, issues found

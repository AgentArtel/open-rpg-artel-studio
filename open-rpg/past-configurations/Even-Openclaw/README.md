# Even-Openclaw — Past Configuration Snapshot

This folder contains a snapshot of the **root** `.ai` directory from the [Even-Openclaw](https://github.com/AgentArtel/Even-Openclaw) (ClawLens) project: tasks, status, templates, walkthroughs, boundaries, and coordination files.

## Scope

- **Included here:** Root `.ai/` only (task briefs, status.md, boundaries.md, templates, walkthroughs, etc.).
- **Not included:** Subproject `.ai` folders (eveng1 plugin, clawlens-companion dashboard) and root-level files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules, docs/) remain in the main Even-Openclaw repo only.

## Handoff context

For full context when resuming or auditing this project:

| Asset | Location |

| AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md | Main repo root |
| .cursor/rules/ | Main repo `.cursor/rules/` |
| docs/ (CHAT-RECOVERY, GATEWAY-TESTING, etc.) | Main repo `docs/` |
| Subproject .ai (eveng1, clawlens-companion) | Main repo only: `ai-agent-backend/extensions/eveng1/.ai/`, `frontend-lovable/clawlens-companion/.ai/` |

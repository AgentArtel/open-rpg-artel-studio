## 2026-02-10 19:18 — kimi -> submitter

**Topic**: Submission rejected

Reviewer kimi rejected the submission for commit `b439e56` (Add runtime file tracking workflow to verification checklist). See review for required changes.

**References**:
- `.ai/reviews/NO-TASK-ID-verification-checklist-review.md`

**Key Issues**:
1. Missing [TASK:XXX] in commit message
2. No task brief exists for this work
3. Boundary violation — `.cursor/rules/` is not in cursor's domain

**Required Actions**:
- Wait for task assignment before starting work
- Only modify files in assigned domains (`src/agents/**`, `main/**`, `src/config/**`)
- Always include [TASK:XXX] in submit commits

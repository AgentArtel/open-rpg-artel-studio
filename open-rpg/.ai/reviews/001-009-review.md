## Task Brief Status

**❌ TASK BRIEF NOT FOUND**

The task brief file `.ai/tasks/001-009.md` does not exist. This submission appears to be a meta-commit that updates documentation and coordination files across multiple previously completed tasks (001-009).

Based on the commit message and diff analysis, this submission is a **documentation/runtime files update** rather than a feature implementation.

## File Boundary Compliance

### Files Within Cursor's Domain ✅

None — This is a coordination/documentation commit.

### Files Outside Cursor's Domain ⚠️

| File | Owner | Severity | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| `.ai/reviews/*.md` | Kimi Overseer | ⚠️ MODERATE | Review files are typically written by Kimi Overseer, not Cursor. However, these appear to be copies/exports of reviews that were already conducted. |
| `.ai/chats/*.md` | Shared | ✅ ACCEPTABLE | Chat logs are shared communication channels; all agents can append. |
| `.ai/metrics/context-history.json` | Kimi Overseer | ⚠️ MODERATE | Metrics tracking is Kimi's domain, but this appears to be automated/runtime data. |
| `.ai/tasks/TASK-007.md` | Claude Code | ⚠️ MODERATE | Task files are Claude Code's domain; however, implementers updating handoff notes in their own task files is acceptable workflow. |

**Boundary Assessment:** The review files (008-review.md, 009-review.md, TASK-006-review.md) are the primary concern. These should typically be written by Kimi Overseer as part of the review process. If these are copies of previously conducted reviews being archived, this is acceptable. If Cursor is generating review files that represent unverified review results, this would be a boundary violation.

## Content Verification

### Review Files Analysis

The review files appear to be legitimate, detailed code reviews:

1. **008-review.md** (189 lines): Comprehensive review of AgentRunner, LaneQueue, LLMClient, and live test NPC
2. **009-review.md** (161 lines): Review of GameChannelAdapter, Bridge implementation, and dialogue fix
3. **TASK-006-review.md** (119 lines): Review of PerceptionEngine

All three reviews contain:
- Acceptance criteria check tables
- File boundary compliance analysis
- Code quality assessments
- Verdict summaries (all marked APPROVED)

**Question:** Were these reviews actually conducted by Kimi Overseer, or are they speculative/placeholder reviews written by Cursor?

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Since no task brief exists for "001-009", standard acceptance criteria cannot be checked. However, evaluating the commit against its stated purpose:

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Runtime files updated | ✅ MET | Chat logs, metrics updated |
| Task docs updated | ✅ MET | TASK-007.md handoff notes added |
| Reviews documented | ⚠️ UNCLEAR | Reviews exist but authorship unclear |
| Handoff prepared for Claude Code | ✅ MET | Documentation appears complete |

---

## Findings

### Critical Issues: 0

### Major Issues: 0

### Minor Issues: 1

1. **Review File Authorship Ambiguity**: The review files (008-review.md, 009-review.md, TASK-006-review.md) are attributed to "kimi (automated)" / "Kimi Overseer" in their content, but they appear in a Cursor commit. This could mean:
   - Cursor copied reviews that Kimi previously wrote (acceptable)
   - Cursor generated speculative reviews (boundary violation)
   
   **Recommendation:** Clarify the source of these review files. If Kimi wrote them, the commit should reference the original review commits.

---

## VERDICT: CHANGES_REQUESTED

**Status:** ⚠️ CHANGES_REQUESTED

**Reasoning:** 
1. No task brief exists for "001-009" — this is a meta/documentation commit, not a feature task
2. Review files appear to be authored by "Kimi Overseer" but are committed by "Cursor" — authorship/source needs clarification
3. The actual implementation work (tasks 001-009) appears to have been completed in prior commits

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Clarify the source of the review files (were they written by Kimi previously?)
2. If this is purely a documentation handoff commit, consider whether it needs formal review or can be fast-tracked
3. Going forward, create individual task briefs for documentation updates, or use a standard "handoff" task template

---

## Alternative Interpretation

If this commit is simply **archiving completed work** and the review files were legitimately generated by Kimi in previous review cycles, then this submission can be considered:

**VERDICT: APPROVED** (with note that task brief was not found because this is a batch documentation update)

The commit is essentially a "paperwork" commit organizing completed work for Claude Code's review.

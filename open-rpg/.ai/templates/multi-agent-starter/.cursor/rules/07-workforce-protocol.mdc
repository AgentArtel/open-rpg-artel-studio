# Cursor Workforce Protocol

This project uses a **Manager + Task Chat** workflow pattern.
See `.ai/CURSOR_WORKFORCE.md` for the full guide.

## Chat Roles

**Manager Chat** (Chat mode — no code writing):
- Plans implementation approaches for features
- Produces scoped task briefs for Task Chats
- Reviews completion reports from Task Chats
- Tracks session progress
- Never writes code directly

**Task Chat** (Agent/Composer mode — writes code):
- Receives a single task brief
- Reads the specified files, implements the changes
- Produces a completion report when done
- Stays within Cursor's file boundaries (see AGENTS.md)

## Task Brief Format (Manager → Task Chat)

```
TASK: [Short title]
FILES IN SCOPE: [Files to read and modify]
OBJECTIVE: [What "done" looks like]
APPROACH: [Step-by-step plan]
CONSTRAINTS:
- [Boundary rules]
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] [Testable criterion]
```

## Completion Report Format (Task Chat → Manager)

```
COMPLETED: [Task title]
STATUS: Done | Partial | Blocked
FILES CHANGED:
- [file]: [what changed]
DECISIONS: [Judgment calls made]
ISSUES: [Problems encountered]
TESTS: [How to verify]
```

## Boundaries Reminder

You (Cursor) own implementation files. Before modifying any file, check
that it's in Cursor's domain per AGENTS.md. If you need changes to:
- `src/components/ui/**` → Flag for Lovable
- `App.tsx` routing, configs, migrations → Flag for Claude Code
- Auto-generated files → Do not touch

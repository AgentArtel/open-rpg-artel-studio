# NPC Social Media, Associative Memory, and Fragment Quests

## The Idea in One Sentence

NPCs create tagged content (images, text, posts), recall it through semantic tag matching
when their environment triggers associations, share it on an in-game social feed (Instagram
clone), and players interact with this system through **Fragments** — collectible items
that unlock past memories or future visions when brought to the right NPC.

---

## Three Interlocking Systems

### 1. NPC Content + Semantic Tagging

Every piece of content an NPC creates gets stored with semantic tags derived from the
NPC's current perception and the content itself.

**Example:** Clara photographs a sunset in village_square while Player_Alex watches.

```
npc_content:
  type: 'image'
  url: 'https://...'
  text: 'Golden hour over the village well'

content_tags:
  ['sunset', 'golden_light', 'village_square', 'well', 'player_alex',
   'afternoon', 'beauty', 'warmth', 'portrait_opportunity']
```

Tags come from two sources:
- **Perception tags** — automatically extracted from the perception snapshot (map, entities, time)
- **Content tags** — LLM analyzes what was created and adds semantic labels

### 2. Associative Recall (Environment-Driven Memory)

When an NPC perceives their environment, the perception tags are matched against all
their stored content. Content with the most tag overlaps surfaces as the strongest memory.

**The key insight:** Same environment → same perception tags → same memories recalled →
stable, consistent personality. New environment → new tags → different memories surface →
personality naturally evolves.

```
Clara in village_square (daily routine):
  Perception tags: ["village_square", "well", "afternoon_light", "trees"]
  Recalled: her village photos, conversations with regulars
  → Warm, familiar: "The light is lovely today, as always."

Clara moved to dark_forest (first visit):
  Perception tags: ["dark_forest", "shadows", "mist", "silence"]
  Recalled: nothing matches → zero recall
  → Uncertain, discovering: "I've never captured darkness before..."

Clara in dark_forest (third visit):
  Perception tags: ["dark_forest", "shadows", "mist"]
  Recalled: her 2 prior dark_forest photos
  → Adapting: "Last time I found beauty in the shadow patterns..."
```

**Recall formula:**
```
score = tag_overlap_count × recency_weight
```

Simple. No embeddings needed for MVP. Just count matching tags and weight by recency.

### 3. NPC Social Feed (Instagram Clone)

NPCs post their content to a social feed visible outside the game. The feed lives in
the Lovable frontend as a grid of NPC-created content.

**Content pipeline:**
```
NPC creates content → stored in npc_content with tags
  ↓
NPC calls create_post skill → row in npc_posts (links to npc_content)
  ↓
Post appears in Lovable feed UI (filterable by NPC)
  ↓
Human likes/approves posts in the feed
  ↓
(Toggle) Approved posts auto-post to real Instagram via Meta Graph API
```

**All NPCs see the same feed** but interpret it differently. The Musician sees Clara's
sunset photo and gets inspired to compose a song. The Seer sees a prophecy in the same
image. Same data, different output — personality emerges from capability, not scripting.

## Fragment Quest System

Fragments are the game mechanic that makes the content system tangible to players.

### What Fragments Are

Fragments are collectible items scattered across the game world. Each fragment contains
tagged metadata — themes, emotions, locations, entities — but no readable content.
They're mysterious shards that need interpretation.

### Two Types

**Past Fragments** — contain tags matching existing content. When interpreted, they
surface memories: images NPCs already created, conversations that happened, moments
captured. "This fragment holds echoes of a sunset someone once loved."

**Future Fragments** — contain tags that don't yet match existing content. When
interpreted, they trigger NEW content generation (Gemini image, Gemini video).
The interpretation becomes real content in the system, seeding future memories.
"This fragment shows a vision of what may come."

### The Quest Loop

```
1. EXPLORE → Player finds a Fragment on the map (or chooses their first one)
2. DISCOVER → Fragment description hints at its nature but not its meaning
3. SEEK → Player takes Fragment to a service NPC (Seer, Photographer, Musician)
4. INTERPRET → NPC reads the Fragment:
   - Past Fragment: NPC recalls matching content, tells the story
   - Future Fragment: NPC generates new content, creates the vision
5. REWARD → Player receives the interpretation (image, story, prophecy)
6. RIPPLE → Generated content enters the tag system, available for future recall
```

### Starter Fragment Choice

New players choose their first Fragment from 3 options (Pokemon starter mechanic):

| Fragment | Tags | Leads To | Theme |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| Lens Fragment | visual, light, beauty, capture | Photographer Clara | "A shard that refracts light into stories" |
| Melody Fragment | sound, rhythm, emotion, harmony | Musician (future NPC) | "A shard that hums with forgotten songs" |
| Vision Fragment | time, fate, possibility, truth | Seer (future NPC) | "A shard that shows what was and what may be" |

The choice shapes which NPC ecosystem the player enters first, creating natural
divergent paths through the same world.

### Fragment Data Structure

```typescript
interface Fragment {
  id: string
  name: string                    // "Sunset Lens Fragment"
  type: 'past' | 'future'
  tags: string[]                  // Semantic tags for matching
  description: string             // Flavor text (player sees this)
  interpreterSkill: string        // Which skill interprets it: 'generate_image', 'generate_music', etc.
  rarity: 'common' | 'rare' | 'legendary'
  consumed: boolean               // One-time use or reusable
}
```

## Database Schema

All stored in Supabase (extends existing tables):

```sql
-- Content created by NPCs (images, text, any output)
create table npc_content (
  id            uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  agent_id      text not null,
  content_type  text not null,          -- 'image', 'text', 'conversation', 'prophecy'
  url           text,                   -- media URL (images, videos)
  text_content  text,                   -- caption, story, description
  source_context jsonb default '{}',    -- perception snapshot when created
  created_at    timestamptz default now()
);

-- Semantic tags on content (many-to-many)
create table content_tags (
  content_id  uuid references npc_content on delete cascade,
  tag         text not null,
  confidence  float default 1.0,        -- 0.0-1.0 strength
  source      text default 'perception', -- 'perception', 'llm', 'manual', 'fragment'
  primary key (content_id, tag)
);

-- Social media posts (Instagram clone layer)
create table npc_posts (
  id                uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  content_id        uuid references npc_content on delete cascade,
  agent_id          text not null,
  npc_name          text not null,
  caption           text,
  approved          boolean default false,
  posted_externally boolean default false,
  likes             integer default 0,
  created_at        timestamptz default now()
);

-- Fragments (collectible quest items)
create table fragments (
  id               uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name             text not null,
  fragment_type    text not null,       -- 'past' or 'future'
  tags             text[] not null,     -- semantic tags for matching
  description      text,               -- player-visible flavor text
  interpreter_skill text,              -- 'generate_image', 'generate_music', etc.
  rarity           text default 'common',
  spawn_map        text,               -- which map it spawns on
  spawn_x          integer,
  spawn_y          integer,
  created_at       timestamptz default now()
);

-- Track which player has which fragments + interpretation results
create table player_fragments (
  player_id     text not null,
  fragment_id   uuid references fragments,
  found_at      timestamptz default now(),
  interpreted   boolean default false,
  interpreted_by text,                 -- agent_id of interpreter
  result_content_id uuid references npc_content,  -- the interpretation output
  primary key (player_id, fragment_id)
);

-- Index for fast tag-based recall
create index idx_content_tags_tag on content_tags(tag);
create index idx_npc_content_agent on npc_content(agent_id);
create index idx_npc_posts_agent on npc_posts(agent_id);
```

### Recall Query

```sql
-- Find NPC's memories matching current perception tags
select c.*, count(ct.tag) as relevance, max(c.created_at) as recency
from npc_content c
join content_tags ct on c.id = ct.content_id
where c.agent_id = $1
  and ct.tag = any($2)          -- $2 = array of current perception tags
group by c.id
order by relevance desc, recency desc
limit 5;
```

### Fragment Interpretation Query

```sql
-- Find content matching a past fragment's tags
select c.*, count(ct.tag) as relevance
from npc_content c
join content_tags ct on c.id = ct.content_id
where ct.tag = any($1)           -- $1 = fragment.tags
group by c.id
order by relevance desc
limit 3;
```

## How It Integrates With Existing Architecture

| Existing System | Integration Point |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `PerceptionEngine` | Extract tags from snapshots → feed into recall queries |
| `SupabaseAgentMemory` | Add `recall(tags)` method alongside `getRecentContext()` |
| `AgentRunner` | Inject recalled content into system prompt context |
| `generate_image` (TASK-018) | After generating, store in `npc_content` + auto-tag |
| `SkillRegistry` | Add `create_post` skill, `interpret_fragment` skill |
| `AgentManager` | Load fragment configs, manage content lifecycle |
| Lovable frontend | New feed page consuming `npc_posts` from Supabase |
| Supabase | 5 new tables (above), 2 new indexes |

## Implementation Plan

See **[09a-social-memory-fragments-implementation-plan.md](09a-social-memory-fragments-implementation-plan.md)**

### Task Breakdown

| Task | Title | What | Depends On |
|------|-------|------|------------|
| TASK-019 | NPC Content + Semantic Tagging | Supabase tables, `create_post` skill, auto-tag pipeline | TASK-012, TASK-018 |
| TASK-020 | Associative Recall + Identity Pillars | Recall query, perception-to-tag extraction, AgentRunner injection | TASK-019 |
| TASK-021 | Lovable Feed UI + Instagram Bridge | Frontend feed, like/approve, optional real Instagram API | TASK-019 |
| — | Fragment Quest System | Fragment items, `interpret_fragment` skill, starter choice | TASK-019, TASK-020 |

## Open Questions

1. **Fragment spawning** — Static map placement or dynamic random spawns?
2. **Fragment rarity** — How rare should legendary fragments be? Economy balance.
3. **Real Instagram API** — Meta Business account required. Defer until feed UI is proven.
4. **Cross-NPC interpretation** — Can Clara interpret a Melody Fragment? (Probably not — skills gate it.)
5. **Content expiry** — Generated image URLs may expire. Need Supabase Storage for persistence when needed. (We use Gemini for image/video/sound.)
6. **Tag vocabulary** — Free-form LLM tagging or controlled vocabulary? (Start free-form, constrain later.)
7. **Recall context window** — How many recalled items to inject? (Start with 3, tune based on token budget.)

## Success Criteria

### MVP (TASK-019 + 020)
- NPC generates image → auto-tagged and stored in `npc_content`
- NPC's next perception triggers recall of relevant past content
- NPC references recalled content in conversation ("I photographed a similar sunset last week...")
- Content visible in Supabase dashboard (tables populated correctly)

### Feed UI (TASK-021)
- Lovable frontend shows grid of NPC posts
- Filter by NPC name
- Like button sets `approved: true`
- Posts display: image, caption, NPC name, timestamp

### Fragments (Future)
- Player finds fragment on map
- Takes to Seer/Photographer → NPC interprets
- Past fragments surface existing content
- Future fragments generate new content
- Starter fragment choice works for new players

# Scaffold RPGJS Starter Project (Updated)

## Overview

Scaffold the RPGJS starter using `degit`, preserving all `.gitkeep` files and the agent system directories. The `.gitkeep` files ensure empty directories are tracked by git, which is important for maintaining the agent system structure.

## Steps

### 1. Preserve All .gitkeep Files

- **Keep all `.gitkeep` files** - they serve to track empty directories in git
- Important directories to preserve:
- `src/agents/core/.gitkeep`
- `src/agents/memory/.gitkeep`
- `src/agents/bridge/.gitkeep`
- `src/agents/skills/.gitkeep`
- `src/agents/perception/.gitkeep`
- `src/config/.gitkeep`
- `maps/.gitkeep` (starter may populate, but keep as fallback)
- `assets/sprites/.gitkeep` (starter may populate, but keep as fallback)
- `assets/tilesets/.gitkeep` (starter may populate, but keep as fallback)

### 2. Remove Only Empty src/modules/ Structure

- Remove the empty `src/modules/` directory structure
- This will be completely replaced by the RPGJS starter
- The starter will create `src/modules/main/` with proper game code

### 3. Scaffold RPGJS Starter

- Run `npx degit rpgjs/starter .` to scaffold into current directory
- The `degit` command will:
- Preserve existing files (AGENTS.md, .cursor/, .ai/, docs/, src/agents/, src/config/)
- Create `src/modules/main/` with server/client structure
- Add `package.json`, `rpg.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.
- Add game assets, maps, and configuration files
- May populate `maps/` and `assets/` directories (which is fine - real files take precedence over .gitkeep)

### 4. Verify Preservation

- Check that critical files are intact:
- `AGENTS.md` (root)
- `.cursor/` directory
- `.ai/` directory
- `docs/` directory
- `src/agents/` directory structure with all .gitkeep files
- `src/config/.gitkeep`
- If anything was overwritten, restore from git

### 5. Install Dependencies

- Run `npm install` to install RPGJS dependencies
- Verify `package.json` includes RPGJS packages

### 6. Verify Final Structure

- Confirm the final structure has:
- RPGJS game files in `src/modules/main/`
- Agent system scaffolding in `src/agents/` (with .gitkeep files)
- Project docs in root and `docs/`
- Configuration files (package.json, rpg.toml, tsconfig.json)
- Empty directories still tracked via .gitkeep where needed

## Files to Remove

- `src/modules/` directory (entire empty structure - will be replaced by starter)

## Files to Preserve

- **All `.gitkeep` files** (they track empty directories)
- All files in `src/agents/` (including .gitkeep files)
- `src/config/.gitkeep`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.cursor/` directory
- `.ai/` directory
- `docs/` directory
- `.gitignore`

## Expected Outcome

After scaffolding, the project will have:

- Complete RPGJS starter structure with working game code
- Preserved agent system directory scaffolding with .gitkeep files

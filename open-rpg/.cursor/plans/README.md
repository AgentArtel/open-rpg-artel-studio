# Cursor plans

Plans are design and implementation documents used by Cursor (and for Claude review). **This folder is tracked in git** — do not add `.cursor/plans` to `.gitignore`.

## Structure

- **Root** — Active plans, overviews, and idea docs (e.g. for Claude task creation).
- **archive/** — Completed implementation plans. Move a plan here when its work is done so the root stays focused on current work.

## Naming

Plans use descriptive names with optional hashes (e.g. `gui_design_and_style_improvements_66059fed.plan.md`). When archiving, keep the filename so history stays clear.
